### Clean Coding standards

Code, documentation and feedback shall be in line with principal level scientific elegance, minimalism, conciseness and precision.
That means explicitly long, expressive, pronounceable well chosen names instead of short abbreviating names.
For example appLICATION, depENDENCIES, repoSITORY, syncHRONIZATION, devELOPMENT, prodUCTION, authENTICATION, authORIZATION, deployMENT.
Trying to "save" letters is unprofessional and decreases readability.
Blacklist typical lazy abbreviations, but whitelist very popular context-free acronyms such as OIDC, API, CPU, GPU.
Code is more often read than written and most of the costs come from maintenance.
Code and documentation must be readable as proper technical English text, especially traditional elaborated English.
What is not tested is not supported.
Automation is the best documentation.
We do trunk-based development in the master branch.
