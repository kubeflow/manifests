    # Below is a list of labels to be set by default.
    #
    # To add a namespace label, use `key: 'value'`, for example:
    # istio.io/rev: 'asm-191-1'
    #
    # To remove a namespace label, use `key: ''`. For example:
    # istio-injection: ''
    #
    # Profile controller will not replace a namespace label if its key already
    # exists. If you want to override the value of a previously applied label, you
    # need to:
    # 1. Remove the label by using `key: ''` and deploy.
    # 2. Add the label by using `key: 'value'` and deploy.
