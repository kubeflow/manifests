        If there is a formatting error in your YAML file, you will see errors like the one below:
        'Error: 6:4 [indentation] wrong indentation: expected 2 but found 3'
        
        To fix these errors, refer to the YAML formatting rules at:
        https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rules.html#
        
        Search for the keyword inside the brackets [] in the error message. In this example, it's 'indentation'.
        
        Note: Some rules have been customized in the '.yamllint.yaml' file. Below is the content of that file:

        extends: default

        rules:
          document-start:
            present: false
          document-end:
            present: false
          indentation:
            indent-sequences: false
          line-length:
            max: 400
