# Kustomize Best Practices

  How to utilize kustomize processing directives to minimize errors and produce simple targets

## 1. Identify the resources that encompass a kustomize target

  In most cases these resources are being moved from ksonnet, and per ksonnet component, often include resources like:
  - CustomResourceDefinition
  - ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding or Role, RoleBinding
  - ConfigMap
  - Deployment
  - Service
  - ServiceAccount
  - VirtualService 

  This collection of resources will have a component name if from ksonnet or a name identifying its purpose if new.
  These resources should be moved to a new directory under `manifests/<component>/base`. 
  

### 1a. Resource grouping

  Resources should be organized by kind, where the file name the resource is in is the lower-case hyphenized form of the Resource kind. EG: A Deployment would go in a file named deployment.yaml. A ClusterRoleBinding would go in a file called cluster-role-binding.yaml. If there are multiple resources within a kustomize target eg more than one deployment, you may want to retain a single resource per file and add a prefix|suffix of the resource name to the filename. EG the file name would be `<kind>-<name>.yaml`. The naming should map capital letters to lower hyphenized.

> example: /manifests/profiles

```
profiles
└── base
    ├── README.md
    ├── cluster-role-binding.yaml
    ├── crd.yaml
    ├── deployment.yaml
    ├── kustomization.yaml
    ├── role-binding.yaml
    ├── role.yaml
    ├── service-account.yaml
    └── service.yaml
```

### 1b. Sharing attributes across resources

  There are often repeated attributes across resources, such as labels, namespace, or perhaps a common prefix used for each resource (see next section). You can move these into the kustomization.yaml file and make adjustments within each resource; either shortening its name or removing the label, selector or namespace.

> example: /manifests/profiles/base/kustomization.yaml

```
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- crd.yaml
- service-account.yaml
- cluster-role-binding.yaml
- role.yaml
- role-binding.yaml
- service.yaml
- deployment.yaml
namespace: kubeflow
namePrefix: profiles-
commonLabels:
  kustomize.component: profiles
images:
  - name: gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public/profile-controller
    newName: gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public/profile-controller
    newTag: v20190228-v0.4.0-rc.1-192-g1a802656-dirty-f95773
```

  A kustomize target should always 'build', so you should add what's needed to allow a `kustomize build` to succeed and the unittests work. Note that namespace has been added even though there is a namespace override in a parent kustomization.yaml generated by kfctl under /manifests/profiles. This generated kustomization.yaml provides overrides using values from app.yaml. 

### 1c. Resource names and labels

  Resource names should leverage the kustomize nameprefix that kustomize will insert in front of all resource names or name references. Moving a label that is used in a deployment's metadata and selector to the kustomization.yaml under common labels will shorten and simplify these resources. For example the deployment in profiles would normally look like 

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    kustomize.component: profiles
  name: profiles-deployment
  namespace: kubeflow
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      kustomize.component: profiles
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        kustomize.component: profiles
    spec:
      containers:
      - command:
        - /manager
        image: gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public/profile-controller:v20190228-v0.4.0-rc.1-192-g1a802656-dirty-f95773
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: manager
      serviceAccountName: profiles-controller-service-account
```

  Moving labels, namespace and the nameprefix 'profiles-' to kustomization.yaml reduces deployment.yaml to

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - command:
        - /manager
        image: gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public/profile-controller:v20190228-v0.4.0-rc.1-192-g1a802656-dirty-f95773
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: manager
      serviceAccountName: controller-service-account
```

### Identify common overlays

  Certain resources or resource modifications can be further grouped by a particular concept that cuts across components such as a platform type, an Istio Service, etc. Often other components will be split by similar overlays. 


### Parameters

  We encourage 3 types of kustomize parameters 
  1. vars
  2. patchesStrategicMerge
  3. patchesJson
