                            treats \"global minimum\" as 0, and then the calculation
                            of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible

                            than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less
                            than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew

                            must be DoNotSchedule. \n For example, in a 3-zone cluster,
                            MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with
                            the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2
                            | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains
                            is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated
                            as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector
                            cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3
                            - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew. \n This is a beta field and requires

                            considered to be in the same topology. We consider each
                            <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                            of pods into each bucket. We define a domain as a particular
                            instance of a topology. Also, we define an eligible domain
                            as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy
                            and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname",
                            each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey
                            is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain
                            of that topology. It's a required field.

                                        values (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves
                                        all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                        value is   specified. (Beta) Using this field
                                        requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate

                                  Nodes that have a label with this key and identical
                                  values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                  We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and
                                  try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket.
                                  We define a domain as a particular instance of a
                                  topology. Also, we define an eligible domain as
                                  a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy
                                  and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname",
                                  each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if
                                  TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each
                                  zone is a domain of that topology. It's a required
                                  field.

                                  with a pod if it doesn''t satisfy the spread constraint.
                                  - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not
                                  to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler
                                  to schedule the pod in any location,   but giving
                                  higher precedence to topologies that would help
                                  reduce the   skew. A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable"
                                  for an incoming pod if and only if every possible
                                  node assignment for that pod would violate "MaxSkew"
                                  on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster,
                                  MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector
                                  spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P
                                  P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set
                                  to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                  to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1)
                                  on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words,
                                  the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                  won''t make it *more* imbalanced. It''s a required
