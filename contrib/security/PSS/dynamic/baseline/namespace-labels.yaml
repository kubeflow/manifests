# This file is a duplicate of apps/profiles/upstream/base/namespace-labels.yaml
# as using only the required label to merge it with the existing config map of profiles
# deployment to enable PSS for profile namespaces, leads to creation of a new config map
# with just the PSS label and replaces the pre-exisiting labels in the deployed config map.
# Below is a list of labels to be set by default.
#
# To add a namespace label, use `key: 'value'`, for example:
# istio.io/rev: 'asm-191-1'
#
# To remove a namespace label, use `key: ''`. For example:
# istio-injection: ''
#
# Profile controller will not replace a namespace label if its key already
# exists. If you want to override the value of a previously applied label, you
# need to:
# 1. Remove the label by using `key: ''` and deploy.
# 2. Add the label by using `key: 'value'` and deploy.
