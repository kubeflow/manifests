# TODO(https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/issues/774): 
# The core package is intended to be used as part of the migration as we
# work on #774. The purpose of this package is to define a kustomization
# package that contains the shared bits to be reused across jupyter/jupyter-web-app/base
# (which is the legacy package) and overlays/stacks which will be the new one.
