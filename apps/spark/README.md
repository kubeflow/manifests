# Kubeflow Spark Operator

## What is Spark Operator?

The Kubernetes Operator for Apache Spark aims to make specifying and running [Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark) applications as easy and idiomatic as running other workloads on Kubernetes. It uses [Kubernetes custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) for specifying, running, and surfacing status of Spark applications.

## Update

Please use the synchronization script in /scripts.
