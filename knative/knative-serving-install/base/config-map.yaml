    # The Revision ContainerConcurrency field specifies the maximum number
    # of requests the Container can handle at once. Container concurrency
    # target percentage is how much of that maximum to use in a stable
    # state. E.g. if a Revision specifies ContainerConcurrency of 10, then
    # the Autoscaler will try to maintain 7 concurrent connections per pod
    # on average.
    # Note: this limit will be applied to container concurrency set at every
    # level (ConfigMap, Revision Spec or Annotation).
    # For legacy and backwards compatibility reasons, this value also accepts
    # fractional values in (0, 1] interval (i.e. 0.7 â‡’ 70%).
    # Thus minimal percentage value must be greater than 1.0, or it will be
    # treated as a fraction.

    # try to maintain when concurrency is used as the scaling metric for a

    # the autoscaler will horizontally scale the application based on this
    # target RPS.

    # Activator in the request path if the current spare capacity of the
    # service is less than this setting.
    # If this setting is 0, then Activator will be in the request path only
    # when the revision is scaled to 0.
    # If this setting is > 0 and container-concurrency-target-percentage is
    # 100% or 1.0, then activator will always be in the request path.

    # When observed average concurrency during the panic window reaches

    # scales on the average concurrency over the panic window which is

    # When computing the panic window it will be rounded to the closest
    # whole second.
