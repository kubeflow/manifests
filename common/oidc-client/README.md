# Kubeflow Authentication using OIDC

## Istio Envoy Filter

> EnvoyFilter provides a mechanism to customize the Envoy configuration generated by Istio Pilot. Use EnvoyFilter to modify values for certain fields, add specific filters, or even add entirely new listeners, clusters, etc.[^1]

Kubeflow will use an Envoy Filter for every incoming request when is used
with `oidc-authservice`.

Usage of EnvoyFilter is currently not recommended. The preferred method for configuring External
Authentication in Istio is the `envoyExtAuthzHttp` extension provider[^2].

Envoy Filter is set up with [oidc-authservice](https://github.com/arrikto/oidc-authservice).

## Istio envoyExtAuthzHttp

This is Istio's recommended approach for External Authorization[^2]. It is not limited to the use
of `oauth2-proxy`[^3] alone. This method is an industry standard, meeting all of Kubeflow's
current and foreseeable authentication needs.

For more details on this integration, please see [oauth2-proxy/README.md](oauth2-proxy/README.md).
