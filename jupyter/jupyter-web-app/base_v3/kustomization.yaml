# TODO(https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/issues/774):
# This is a new kustomization file intended to get rid of the
# need to rely on kfctl to build the kustomization.yaml file.
# We might want to eventually move it to jupyter/jupyter-web-app/kustomization.yaml
# We currently don't do that because we don't want to interfere with existing behavior.
#
# This kustomization.yaml file doesn't depend on base/kustomization.yaml
# because that file contains changes that won't work with the new stack kustomize
# packages that we want to define. For example, we can't define vars namespace, clusterDomain
# etc... because we want those to be defined at the stack level and reused across applications.
# We don't want to modify jupyter-web-app/kustomization.yaml because that would
# break the existing KFDef files. So we want to make the stacks work 
# and then replace it.
