    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # resourceLock controls which API resource is used as the basis for the
    # leader election lock. Valid values are:
    #
    # - leases -> use the coordination API
    # - configmaps -> use configmaps
    # - endpoints -> use endpoints
    resourceLock: "leases"

    # leaseDuration is how long non-leaders will wait to try to acquire the
    # lock; 15 seconds is the value used by core kubernetes controllers.
    leaseDuration: "15s"
    # renewDeadline is how long a leader will try to renew the lease before
    # giving up; 10 seconds is the value used by core kubernetes controllers.
    renewDeadline: "10s"
    # retryPeriod is how long the leader election client waits between tries of
    # actions; 2 seconds is the value used by core kubernetes controllers.
    retryPeriod: "2s"
    # enabledComponents is a comma-delimited list of component names for which
    # leader election is enabled. Valid values are:
    #
    # - controller
    # - hpaautoscaler
    # - certcontroller
    # - istiocontroller
    # - nscontroller
