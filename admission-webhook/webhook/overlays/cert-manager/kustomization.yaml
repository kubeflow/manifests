# This overlay uses CertManager to provision a certificate for the
# PodDefaults admission controller. This is preferred over the old
# way of using "bootstrap" which was running a shell script to create
# the certificate.
# TODO(jlewi): We should eventually refactor the manifests to delete
# bootstrap and use certmanager by default.
