# Configuration file for the Jupyter UI.
#
# Each Jupyter UI option is configured by two keys: 'value' and 'readOnly'
# - The 'value' key contains the default value
# - The 'readOnly' key determines if the option will be available to users
#
# If the 'readOnly' key is present and set to 'true', the respective option
# will be disabled for users and only set by the admin. Also when a
# Notebook is POSTED to the API if a necessary field is not present then
# the value from the config will be used.
#
# If the 'readOnly' key is missing (defaults to 'false'), the respective option
# will be available for users to edit.
#
# Note that some values can be templated. Such values are the names of the
# Volumes as well as their StorageClass
